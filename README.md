# LongCovidAnalysis

Overview
This project explores how various numerical factors influence the likelihood of an individual experiencing symptoms of Long COVID-19. By focusing on numerical rather than categorical variables, we aimed to maximize the predictive accuracy and interpretability of our model.

Objective
Our goal was to identify key predictors of Long COVID-19 symptoms using survey data. After evaluating different types of variables, we found that numerical variables offered greater utility for analysis and model performance.

Key Features
Focus on numerical variables for cleaner, more meaningful analysis

Model includes the following predictors:

age

covid_symptoms (initial severity or count of symptoms)

household_income

difficulty_with_expenses

These variables were found to have the strongest influence on predicting whether a respondent would suffer from Long COVID symptoms.

Limitations
While our model provides valuable insights, it is important to recognize potential limitations in the dataset:

Employment status was not considered, which could correlate with exposure levels.

Religious attendance and Hispanic identity were also excluded, which might influence social interaction frequency and health disparities, respectively.

Future research could incorporate these categorical features to improve the robustness of the model.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates that numerical data can effectively predict Long COVID risk, but also highlights areas for further exploration. Improving the diversity and depth of features could lead to even more reliable health predictions in future studies.
